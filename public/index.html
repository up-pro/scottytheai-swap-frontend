      content="In a vast and complex world of cryptocurrency, there existed the legend of a dog named Scotty the AI. He was a Scottish Terrier with shaggy, jet-black fur that shimmered like the night sky, making him both an enigma and a sight to behold. It wasn’t just his appearance that set him apart."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
